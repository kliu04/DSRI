      <h1>Mathematical Information</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Algebraic Geometry is the study of geometric shapes defined by
        polynomial equations. In particular, a complex algebraic variety can be
        understood as the common zero set of a collection of complex polynomials
        in n variables. This means that the solutions to these polynomials,
        known as zeros, reside in \(\mathbb{C}^n\). On webpages and in many
        visual representations, we typically draw only the real points of these
        algebraic varieties. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the
        solutions and properties of complex algebraic varieties extend beyond
        what can be visually represented in real space. To further explore
        algebraic varieties, we introduce the concept of projective space.
        Projective space over a field \(k\), denoted as \(\mathbb{P}^n(k)\), can
        be defined as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of an
        \(n+1\)-dimensional space over \(k\), denoted as \(k^{(n+1)}\). Each
        line in the \(n+1\)-dimensional vector space corresponds to a point in
        the projective space. To assign coordinates to points in projective
        space, we consider the \(n+1\) coordinates \((x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)\)
        in the \(n+1\)-dimensional affine space. However, we exclude the points
        corresponding to the zero vector by requiring that not all \(x_i\) are
        equal to \(0\). We also allow for scaling, meaning that multiplying the
        coordinates by a nonzero scalar does not change the corresponding point.
        So, we include the condition that \((x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) \sim
        (\lambda x_0, \lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n)\) for any nonzero scalar
        \(\lambda\). Projective space can be thought of as taking the affine
        space and adding some points at infinity to complete the projective
        space of lower dimension.
      </p>
      <h2>Singular Points</h2>
      <p>
        In algebraic geometry, a singular point of an algebraic variety refers
        to a point where the variety fails to be smooth or regular. It is a
        point where the tangent space has a dimension greater than the dimension
        of the variety. In the case of plane curves, where the variety is a
        curve in the plane, a point is singular if and only if the gradient
        vectors of the defining equation vanish at that point. If the gradient
        vector does not vanish, the tangent space has dimension 1, which is the
        same as the dimension of the curve. If the gradient vector vanishes, the
        tangent space has dimension 2, which is greater than the dimension of
        the curve. In this case, the tangent space is the whole affine
        plane,which is the wrong dimension. Consider a simple cusp defined by
        the equation \( f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 = 0\). The vanishing set of \(f\)
        (or vanishing locus or zero set) is the set \( V(f)\) of all points in
        \(\mathbb{C}^n\) where every polynomial in \(f\) vanishes. Symbolically,
        \(V(f) = \left\{ (x, y) \mid f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 = 0 \right\}\). The
        partial derivatives help us determine the points where the gradient
        vector in the defining equation vanishes, which correspond to points
        where the tangent space has dimension greater than the curve's
        dimension. To find the singular points, we consider the partial
        derivatives of the defining equation \(f\) with respect to each
        variable. For the curve \(f(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 = 0\), we have:
        \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2\) and \(\frac{\partial
        f}{\partial y} = 2y\). The singular points occur where both partial
        derivatives are simultaneously zero. In this case, setting both partial
        derivatives to zero, we get \(-3x^2 = 0\) and \(2y = 0\). From the
        second equation, we have \(y = 0\), and substituting this into the first
        equation, we find \(x = 0\). Therefore, the only singular point of the
        curve is at the origin, \((0:0:1)\), where both partial derivatives
        vanish.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our webpage, these points are represented by homogeneous coordinates
        consisting of three variables. We want to utilize projective geometry to
        solve for points at infinity. First, we homogenize the equation by
        introducing an additional variable, \(z\), which transforms our point in
        the Cartesian plane into a line passing through the origin in a
        three-dimensional space. Subsequently, we de-homogenize the equation by
        setting \(z\) to 1. This results in a reference plane where \(z=1\),
        which is parallel to the Cartesian plane. Any non-horizontal line will
        intersect the reference plane at a unique point. In the Cartesian plane,
        the horizontal line corresponds to points at infinity.

      <h2>Degree</h2>
      <p>
        The degree of a hypersurface in the projective space is defined as the
        degree of the homogeneous defining polynomial.
      </p>
      <h2>Multiplicity</h2>
      <p>
        How can we quantify the singularity at a point? We focus attention on
        one point and translate it into our origin by changing our coordinates
        in the space we are looking at. This naïve measure of singularities
        gives us the formal definition of multiplicities: The order (or
        multiplicity) of singularities [at the origin \(0\)] is the degree of
        the lowest term in \(f\). Let's think about what this invariant means
        for plane curves. If we think about what's happening near the origin for
        a curve defined by the zero set of \(y^2-x^2+x^3\), the lower degree
        terms \(y^2-x^2\) as we plug in very small values are going to dominate
        what's happening of the story of the function. This is because the
        higher degree terms will be going to zero even faster. So, near the
        origin the curve will look like the zero set of the lowest degree part
        of its defining polynomial. Thus, the multiplicity of singularities at
        the origin is \(2\).
      </p>
      <img src="img2.png" class="d-flex mx-auto" />
      <h2>Branching Number</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of algebraic curves, branch points correspond to
        singularities where the curve intersects or crosses itself. The
        branching number associated with each branch point indicates the number
        of branches originating from that point. For example, the branching
        number of the singular point of this curve at the origin is \(8\).
      </p>
      <img src="img3.png" class="d-flex mx-auto" />
      <h2>Genus</h2>
      <p>
        The genus-degree formula in classical algebraic geometry relates the
        degree \(d\) of a plane curve \(C\) in the projective plane \(ℙ²\) to
        its arithmetic genus \(g\). The formula states that the genus \(g\) is
        given by \(g = \frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)\). The arithmetic genus measures
        the number of "holes" or handles in the curve when viewed as a
        topological surface. In the case of a non-singular curve, where \(C\)
        has no singular points, the geometric genus coincides with the
        arithmetic genus. However, for singular curves with only ordinary
        singularities, the geometric genus is smaller than the arithmetic genus.
        An ordinary singularity of multiplicity \(r\) at a point
        \((x_0:y_0:z_0)\) occurs when the defining equation of the curve locally
        resembles \(x^r - y^r = 0\). At this singularity, the tangent space has
        dimension \(2\) and the partial derivatives of the defining equation are
        simultaneously zero. Specifically, the tangent space at \(p=(p_1,p_2)\)
        is defined by the vanishing of the linear part \(d_p(f) = \frac{\partial
        f}{\partial x} (p) (x-p_1) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (p) (y-p_2)
        \) of \(f\) at \(p\). The presence of ordinary singularities impacts the
        overall genus of the curve. Each ordinary singularity of multiplicity
        \(r\) decreases the genus by \(\frac{1}{2}r(r-1)\). Thus, to compute the
        genus \(g\) of a curve with ordinary singularities, we start with the
        arithmetic genus \(p_a\), given by the formula \(p_a = \binom{d-1}{2}\),
        where \(d\) is the degree of the curve. Then, we subtract
        \(\frac{1}{2}r(r-1)\) for each ordinary singularity of multiplicity
        \(r\).
      </p>
      <img src="img4.png" class="d-flex mx-auto" />
      <h2>Delta Invariant</h2>
      <p>
        The delta invariant is a numerical value that helps classify
        singularities and provides information about their local behavior. It
        measures the number of ordinary double points concentrated at a point.
        Intuitively, a singular point has a delta invariant \( \delta \) if it
        concentrates \( \delta \) ordinary double points at \( P \). At each
        singular point \( x \in \mathbb{C} \), denoted as \( \delta_x \), the
        delta invariant is calculated as \( \frac{1}{2} m_x (m_x - 1) \), where
        \( m_x \) represents the multiplicity of \( x \) as a singular point.
        The multiplicity can be determined by examining the Taylor series or
        polynomial expansion of the defining equation of the curve. The highest
        total degree partial derivative that does not vanish at the singular
        point \( x \) provides the multiplicity. The delta invariant of the
        curve \( C \), denoted as \( \delta \), is obtained by summing up the
        delta invariants over all singular points (including infinitely near
        singular points): \( \delta = \sum_x \delta_x \). The geometric genus \(
        g \) of a curve with singularities can then be determined using the
        formula \( g = p_a - \delta \), where \( p_a \) is the arithmetic genus
        of the curve.
      </p>
      <h2>Milnor Number</h2>
      <p>
        The Milnor number is a topological invariant of a singularity. Consider
        a function germ denoted by \( f : (\mathbb{C}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)
        \), where \( (\mathbb{C}^n, 0) \) represents the complex n-dimensional
        space and \( (\mathbb{C}, 0) \) represents the complex plane. The ring
        of all function germs from \( (\mathbb{C}^n, 0) \) to \( (\mathbb{C}, 0)
        \) is denoted by \(\mathcal{O}_n\). Let's assume that the hypersurface
        singularity \( f \) is singular at \( 0 \in \mathbb{C}^n \). In the case
        of holomorphic mappings, we say that a hypersurface singularity \( f \)
        is singular at \( 0 \) if its gradient \( \nabla f \) is zero at \( 0
        \). A singular point is isolated if it is the only singular point in a
        sufficiently small neighborhood.
      </p>
      <h2>Tjurina Number</h2>
      <p>
        Let \( f: (\mathbb{C}^n, 0) \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}, 0) \) be a germ of
        an isolated hypersurface singularity. We denote by \( T_f =
        \frac{\mathbb{C}\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}}{(f, \frac{\partial f}{\partial
        x_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n})} \) the tangent space and
        by \( M_f = \frac{\mathbb{C}\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}}{(\frac{\partial
        f}{\partial x_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n})} \) the
        module of the singularity. Both \( T_f \) and \( M_f \) are complex
        finite-dimensional vector spaces. The Tjurina number, denoted by \( \tau
        \), is defined as the dimension of the tangent space, i.e., \( \tau =
        \dim_{\mathbb{C}} T_f \). It serves as an analytic invariant of the
        singularity and provides important information about its local behavior.
      </p>
      <h2>Milnor-Jung Formula</h2>
      <p>
        The Milnor-Jung formula is a mathematical formula that relates the
        Milnor number (\( \mu \)) of a plane curve singularity to its branching
        number (\( r \)) and multiplicity (\( m \)). The formula at a singular
        point \(p\) is given by: \[ \mu_p = 2\delta_p - r_p + 1. \] Here, the
        branching number (\( r_p \)) of a singularity is the number of locally
        irreducible branches at the singular point, and the multiplicity (\( m_p
        \)) is the maximum number of branches passing through the singular
        point. The parameter \( \delta_p \) is the delta-invariant, which is
        related to the topological type of the singularity.
